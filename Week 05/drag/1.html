    Addressing cheering supporters in a car park in his hometown of Wilmington, 
    Mr Biden said: "I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify; 
    who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States."

    Mr Biden - who has won more than 74 million votes so far, the most ever for a US 
    presidential candidate - hailed the "diverse" support he gathered during the campaign, 
    and thanked African-American voters in particular.

    But he also reached out to Trump supporters directly.

    "It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, 
    listen to each other again," Mr Biden said, without mentioning his rival in the election. 
    "And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies."
